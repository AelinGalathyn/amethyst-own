# Amethyst
A calm, deep purple theme for Discord heavily inspired by [the Purplous Discord theme](https://github.com/XuaTheGrate/Purplous 'Thanks, Maya and Equity!').

### Customizable margins and rounded corners
As of v1.3.0, you can now customize Amethyst's spacing and corner roundness properties! Simply head over to your Quick CSS, paste the following CSS into it, then adjust each of the `VALUE`s to your likings:

```css
:root {
  --amethyst-margin: `VALUE`px; /* Default spacing: 4px */
  --amethyst-radius: `VALUE`px; /* Default roundness: 10px */
}
```

Here's what Amethyst looks like with the margin property set to `8px` and the radius property to `0px`:
